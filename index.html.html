<hr>
<body><p><h1>

I chose BSIT because ever since I was in high school, I was inspired by watching my cousin do coding and programming.
<br> That’s why I wanted to take an I.T. course However, after graduating from high school and moving into senior high school, 
<br> my mind changed I started wanting to pursue nursing instead. <p></p>
But when I graduated from senior high school, my mom couldn’t afford to send me to a nursing course.
 <br> That’s why I went back to my original plan and chose the I.T. course.
<br>If you ask me whether I regret taking BSIT, my answer is no because I.T. was actually my first choice from the beginning. <p></p>

Another reason I chose BSIT is because of the opportunities it offers.
<br> We live in a digital age where technology plays a vital role in almost every industry.
<br> From healthcare and business to education and entertainment, IT professionals are in demand.
<br> By taking this course, I know I am preparing myself for a career that is both stable and full of possibilities for growth and innovation. <p></p>
Lastly, I chose BSIT because I enjoy learning how to solve problems. 
<br> Programming challenges me to think critically and creatively. 
<br>It’s not always easy, but the satisfaction I get from making a program work or fixing an error motivates me to keep learning and improving.
